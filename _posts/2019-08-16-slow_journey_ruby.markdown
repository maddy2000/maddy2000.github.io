Ok guys I started my journey with flatiron school on 7/15 and I’m expected to complete up to certain section per week. Let me tell you how I have failed at that miserably. I started off on the first section not really understanding what was expected of me. I don’t know it's like all of a sudden, I can’t comprehend directions. I’m struggling every day with each and every lab and the friends that I started off with have surpassed me by weeks. It's crazy it's like when I look at the lessons I’m automatically transformed into another realm with witches and warlocks with no one there to save me because I code by myself every night. Don’t have a partner yet to bounce ideas off. Anyway, as more and more information get thrown at me per lesson the more, I’m worried I’ll forget all of what I have learn in the previous weeks and i won't be able to perform during any of my projects. There is so much in formation that I just cannot process it all and I find myself overwhelmed with classes, Booleans, hashes, arrays, and my personal favorite so far is lol nested hashes. Now there are technicians available to help you if you need the help while doing these labs but the goal is to eventually be able to at least start a method and build a block of code. Sometimes all I can do is start the method because I’m just confused as to what is expected of me. My teacher is great though his name is Dakota and he tries to give me pointers and things to look for and ask myself before I even attempt to code. He has even given me some private tutoring sessions which I was grateful for. Between me and you I think he felt sorry for me., but it's all good. I need him to keep feeling sorry for me so I can keep getting these sessions lol, selfish much. There are also study sessions I can join to go over certain methods if I don’t understand. So, all in all the school is great with great people and it’s not all bad. The problem is me and my brain and I better get it in gear or get left behind. Until next time....... Peace.
